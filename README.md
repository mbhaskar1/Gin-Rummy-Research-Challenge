# EAAI 2021 Gin Rummy Undergraduate Research Challenge Submission

In order to test agent, build the project to a jar file along with the following Maven libraries:

`org.deeplearning4j:deeplearning4j-core:1.0.0-beta6`

`org.deeplearning4j:deeplearning4j-modelimport:1.0.0-beta6`

`org.nd4j:nd4j-native-platform:1.0.0-beta6`
 
 The resulting jar file can be used with https://github.com/MTU-Tonic/vermouth in order to test it against itself or other agents.
 
 The research paper submitted for this challenge can be seen here: https://github.com/mbhaskar1/Gin-Rummy-Research-Challenge/blob/main/Paper%20Submission.pdf. The paper, and the associated agent, are currently undergoing review.
